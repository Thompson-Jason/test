This is a garden of _most_ of my notes. I keep various things here from concepts I am learning to recipes I want to try.

This [[Digital Garden]] is built using [[Quartz]]. I write everything on my local machine in [[Markdown]] using [[Obsidian]] and use a tool called [obsidian-exporter](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) to export my notes into standard markdown.

My plan for this digital garden is just to host the notes that I have taken/are taking about various subjects for me to reference or anyone else to reference.

A system with a base-2 is a binary system. The binary numeral system allows only two states and is represented by the numbers 0 and 1. 

Just like the numbers in the [Decimal](Decimal.md) system use the power of 10 in binary we use the powers of 2  
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 ...

10 in different numbering systems  
[Decimal](Decimal.md) = 10  
[Binary](Binary.md) = 0b1010  
*octal* = 0o12  
[Hexadecimal](Hexadecimal.md) = 0xA (or 0xa)

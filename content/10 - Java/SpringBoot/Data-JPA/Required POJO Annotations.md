title: Required POJO Annotations
---

The required annotations to enable a pojo to be used with data-jpa are

[ @Entity](Data-JPA%20Entity.md)  which turns the class into an [Data-JPA Entity](Data-JPA%20Entity.md)  
* @Table*(name = "\<<Table-Name>\>") which shows which table the POJO maps to in the db
